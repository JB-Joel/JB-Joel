- 👋 Hi, I’m Joel. I am a computer science undergrad.
- 👀 I enjoy challenging myself and learning new things everyday.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming languages technologies such as multithreading, parallelism, and distributed systems (MPI and Akka Actor Model). I have worked on a number of projects, a lot of which are private because they are course material. A few others are publicly available here
- 💞️ I’m Hope to collaborate on a few open source projects in the new future
